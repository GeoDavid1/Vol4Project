    "Efficient pathfinding is a critical aspect of competitive racing across various disciplines, including marathons, cycling tours, and Formula 1 events. This paper delves into the pursuit of identifying optimal trajectories for completing laps on NASCAR tracks with the primary objective of minimizing lap times. A key consideration in achieving high speeds on such tracks is the ability to navigate turns effectively, as exceeding the optimal speed threshold can compromise traction and stability, leading to undesirable outcomes such as skidding or flipping. The concept of the racing line, which involves maximizing turn radii by starting on the outside, hitting the apex, and finishing on the outside of a turn, plays a pivotal role in this endeavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a comprehensive analysis, this study integrates principles of optimal control, vehicle steering dynamics, and friction constraints to formulate strategies for determining the fastest path around a NASCAR track. By leveraging these methodologies, we aim to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between driving dynamics and track geometry, ultimately contributing to the advancement of racing performance and strategy. The findings presented herein offer insights into the intricacies of path optimization in high-speed racing environments and lay the groundwork for further research in this domain."
